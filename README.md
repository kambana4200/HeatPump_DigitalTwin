## Node-RED Flow representing the DT of a Heat Pump Test Bench: Verzion 1.1 on 05 / 2025

### Using this flow: import the .json file on a Node-RED Platform

### Proposed Functionalities on Human Machine Interface:

 1) Interactive dashboard of Heat Pump's Sensor and Actuator datas
 2) Sending Command Control to Heat Pump's Air-Heater
 3) Twin of a PID Corrector

### Communication from and to the DT is encrypted (Data Confidentiality Precaution):
This capture of network traffic to the DT allows to attest the sending of the SSL certificate to the DT with public key exchange
